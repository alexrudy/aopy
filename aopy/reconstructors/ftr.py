:mod:`ftr` â€“ The Fourier Transfomr reconstructor
================================================

The fourier transform reconstructor converts slopes (x and y slope grids) to
phase values. The reconstruction works using the fourier transform of the x
and y slopes, and applying a filter, which accounts for the way in which those
slopes map to phase.

The concept for the reconstructor, and the filters documented here, are taken
from Lisa Poyneer's 2007 dissertaiton.
